“I NEVER TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD USE MY PHONE!!!”
― Bambi, Post-Splitathon

Bambi is the titular antagonist of his own week.

Appearance
Bambi has the appearance of a small farmer with a green hat, red shirt, and blue overalls. During the final segment of Mealie and the now removed song Screwed, he becomes REALLY mad and holds the very destroyed phone in his hands instead of a microphone. During any version of the Splitathon, playing as him, In Supernovae and Glitch, and in the Bambi Update, he doesn't have his overalls. When the player plays as him in Week 5, he wears a green Christmas hat.

Personality
Bambi is a hot headed, easily annoyed by anything, and thinking that everyone who enters his farm is just there to steal his corn, as he is obsessed with corn and loves it, he tries to stop people kicking them out of his farm (Bambi refers to this as "block"), however when someone beats him (e.g. Boyfriend) he starts threatening that he will break his own phone, when he breaks his own phone, he backs off and say that it's a draw. He is shown to be pretty naive, thinking that he has a real phone and not knowing that it's a brick (this is shown in Dave's trivia). He is also annoying, interrupting Dave while he was not singing in Splitathon.
